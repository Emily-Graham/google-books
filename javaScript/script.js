// You should separate DOM functions and non-DOM functions in different modules Example: https://github.com/chillcaw/el-salvador-code-alongs/tree/master/js-modules
// Write as many non-DOM functions as you can
// Functions should do 1 thing, and should be as pure and reusable as possible
// Always use iterators over loops
// Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.
// Bonus (optional, but highly recommended):
// Give feedback to the user when no book results can be found for the query.
// When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, country, languages, etc.
