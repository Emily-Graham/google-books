Aim: to create a responsive book searching site using Google Books API

- Users can search using different parameters (author, title, etc) and retrieve data such as the book cover, author and description
- Users will be able to build a 'shelf' of books from their search results and store/remove them

Implemented: 
- fetch API data based on user search
- turns data into display cards 
- book modals open when cards are clicked for more details
- mobile/large screen design implemented

To Do;
- create local storage bookshelf 
- books can dynamically be saved/removed from shelf
- shelf container can be toggled open/shut
- modals contain dynamic tabs for information
- create tablet design

Design is predominately greyscale to draw attention to the bookcovers and better reflect the user's taste. 
Purple is used sparsely as a highlight for icons and interactive elements.
